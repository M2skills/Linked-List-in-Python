# Linked-List-in-Python
Implementation of Linked List in python

LinkedList.py is a simple implementation of Linked List in python.
I have refered various resources to make the different methods of the Linked List.


Following are the methods implemented

1. isEmpty() : method returns true if the list is empty

2. addToStart(): method to add a node at starting

3. addToEnd() : method to add a node at the end

4. display() : method to display all the elements of the Linked List

5. length() : method that returns the length of the Linked List

6. insert() : method to insert element at a given position in the Linked List

7. removePosition() : method to delete a element at a given position

8. remove() : method to delete a data element

9. findMin() : method that returns the max element

10. findMax() : method that returns the min element

11. count() : method that returns the occurences of an element

12. pop() : pop method removes last element of the Linked List

13. tostring() : method that returns a string of all elements of the String

14. copy() :  method that returns the copy of the list

15. clear() : method that clears the Linked List

16. reverse() : method that returns reversed linked list

17. push() : method pushes element to the Linked List

18. index() : method that returns index of a particular element

19. atIndex() : method that returns element at a particular position

20. toList() : method returns builtin List of python consisting of Elements of Linked List

21. toSet() : method returns builtin Set of python consisting of Elements of Linked List

22. sort() : method that sorts Linked List

23. sorted() : method returns new instance of the sorted LinkedList without changing original Linked List

If you think you have a better implementation for any method or if you have any doubts or if you want some method implementations please feel free to comment.
